### **14th January**
- **Dataset Exploration**:
  - Downloaded and explored the UCI HAR dataset structure.
  - Analyzed the contents:
    - Folders: `train`, `test`
    - Files: `features.txt`, `activity_labels.txt`, `subject_train.txt`, `X_train.txt`, `y_train.txt`, and respective test files.
  - Loaded dataset files using Pandas.
  - Examined feature and activity label mappings (`features.txt`, `activity_labels.txt`).

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Standardized feature values using `StandardScaler`.
  - Verified the integrity of the dataset (no missing or inconsistent values).

### **15th January**
- **Model Development**:
  - Selected logistic Regression for activity classification.
  - Implemented a training pipeline:
    - Trained the model on `X_train` and `y_train`.
    - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  - Evaluated the model on training data:
    - Achieved an accuracy of over 90%.
    - Generated initial metrics (confusion matrix and classification report).

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Extracted and visualized feature importance for better interpretability.

### **16th January**
- **Model Testing**:
  - Tested the trained model on `X_test` and `y_test`.
  - Generated predictions for the test dataset.
  - Evaluated model performance using:
    - Confusion matrix: Visualized classification results for each activity.
    - Classification report: Reviewed precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plotted the confusion matrix as a heatmap.


- **Result Analysis**:
  - Observed consistent test accuracy (>90%) with minimal misclassifications.

### **17th January**
- **Finalization and Documentation**:
  - Organized code into modular scripts:
    - `preprocessing.py`: Data loading and preprocessing logic.
    - `model.py`: Model training, evaluation, and testing pipeline.
  - Created a Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) with:
    - Dataset preprocessing.
    - Model training and evaluation.
    - Results visualization.
  - Added detailed comments and explanations to improve code readability.

- **GitHub Upload**:
  - Uploaded project files:
    - Python scripts (`preprocessing.py`, `model.py`).
    - Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`).
    - `UPDATES.md` file for progress tracking.
